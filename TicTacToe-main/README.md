This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using React, leveraging React states to manage the game state and user interactions. The project provides a classic Tic Tac Toe experience where two players take turns to make their moves and the game declares a winner or ends in a draw.
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

thats all it takes to run it locally :)
